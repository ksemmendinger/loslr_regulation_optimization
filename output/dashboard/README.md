# Plan Formulation and Evaluation Dashboard

This folder contains code for the visual analytics to support rapid plan comparison and evaluation. Results are presented in a R Shiny dashboard. Library requirements for the R environment are available in the `requirements.txt` file.

For efficient load-times, the results from scripts in the `postScripts/` are loaded, formatted, and compressed in the `dataRetrieval.py` file.
