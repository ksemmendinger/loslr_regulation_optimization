Toronto,Context,Context,Context,Context,"The shoreline of Toronto has considerable development, but also a lot of public land. There is approximately 150 km of shoreline, including Toronto Island and the Leslie Street Spit.

Residential development on Toronto Island has the most signficant residential flood risk, although there are small pockets of other residential areas that are susceptible to wave induced flood risk as well as public lands.

Shoreline erosion is also a concern in some areas, particularly the Scarborough Bluffs. It is roughly estimated there are about 1500 buildings directly along the shoreline or near the shoreline and below 77m elevation. In a separate analysis, TRCA/Baird (2019) estimate around 258 residential buildings specifically on Toronto Island.

The City of Toronto and TRCA have identified a range of impacts to public assets, a vital component for the. These impacts are described further in adjacent columns.","There are numerous marinas and a yacht clubs in the Toronto area, some very large in size. A total of 22 facilities responded to the GLAM/LURA survey following 2017. Those facilities identified almost 3200 boat slips at the facilities. 

There are a range of public and private boat launches, although the GLAM Committee does not have a current inventory of these facilities. The Toronto waterfront represents and important recreational asset of the city.","The Toronto shoreline is almost exclusively serviced by municipal water supply and wastewater treatment. As well, there are large water treatment and wastewater treatment facilities directly along the shoreline that service the broader City of Toronto. On Toronto Island, there is also an additional water treatment facility. 

Given the nature of the waterfront, there are also non-municipal industrial water users (i.e. pulling water directly from the lake), although the GLAM Committee does not have an inventory of those facilities.","Public shoreline assets are common along the waterfront in the City of Toronto. The City itself has considerable shoreline within public parks, in addition to Toronto Island (map of east https://www.toronto.ca/wp-content/uploads/2017/09/963b-parksTrailsMap-east.pdf and west parks https://www.toronto.ca/wp-content/uploads/2017/08/867d-parks-trails-map-west.pdf). As well, the Toronto and Region Conservation Authority also maintains land along the shoreline. The Toronto waterfront represents and important recreational asset of the city."

• Impacts to Toronto Islands wastewater treatment pumping stations and potential sewer servicing suspension
• Potential impacts to other wastewater treatment facilities along the waterfront
• Significant local drainage issues during rainfall events for underpasses and low-lying areas throughout downtown Toronto
• Insufficient freeboard under Liverpool Road to pass flows from Krosno Creek in Ajax
• Reduced capacity of river mouths, including the Humber and Don River, in turn reducing the freeboard to Don Valley Parkway for flooding during riverine flooding events on the Lower Don River.

DEMs suggest that between 13% and 20% of baseline buildings (58 to 90 primary and/or second properties) would be flooded or would have water approaching them if the water level reach between 22.75 m and 22.84 m. ,"There are no observations in this water level range, but expect the two main marina facilities in this region to be directly impacted with the possibility of business closures affecting boating community. 
The majority of facilities are likely to require gas and/or electrical shut off, and main building and outbuilding flooding is expected.","The GLAM does not currently have information on water treatment or wastewater infrastructure in this region.
Road flooding (proxy for sewer impacts) is expected to increase from ~45% at  22.75 m to ~50% of road baseline at 22.84 m, based on DEM simulations. Note that the roads are not necessarily unusable, the simulation only indicates that there is water on the road.
","There is considerable private shoreline in this area. There are a few public park areas (in Beauharnois) and inundation and/or erosion impacts are expected within this water level zone with some disruptions to use and possible facility damage. 
According to Lery's city manager, the municipality  is receiving more and more requests each year from its citizens to do repair work on retaining walls (he associates these demands with the acceleration of erosion).

DEM estimates suggest buildings impacted (relative to baseline) go from around 6% at 22.65 m to 10% at 22.72 m (26 to 43 buildings). 
We have little information with the use of septics in the Lery/Beauharnois area right now, and can't make a statement at this point about potential impacts.","Hourly water levels above 22.60 were observed in 2017 and 2019. Based on LURA survey response, levels above 22.60 would be outside normal operation range for boat ramps and fixed docks at local facilities and use of ramps would only be possible with major modifications.
We would expect some building flooding for at least one of the facilities, and based on LURA survey response there would be issues for gas service and electrical supply at the facilities as well.
Parking lot flooding was observed above 22.60 in 2017 and that would be expected to increase based on DEM analysis. According to the simulations, between a water level of 22.60 m and 22.72 m, about 20% to 37% of the parking lot areas would be flooded.","The GLAM does not currently have information on water treatment or wastewater infrastructure in this region.
Road flooding (proxy for sewer impacts) is expected to increase rapidly above 22.60 (max 2017 and 2019 level). There were observations in 2017 regarding road inundation, although it seemed to be fairly localized.
