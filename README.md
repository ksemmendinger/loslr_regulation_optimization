# Plan 2014 Optimization
**Framework to optimize and simulate the Plan 2014 control policy with system objectives**

This repo contains code for the optimization wrapper, simulation model, and objective functions to optimize the Plan 2014 control policy.

Before any runs, you will need to download and compile the many-objective evolutionary algorithm, Borg. A two-part tutorial on setup (with a simple example) is available [here](https://waterprogramming.wordpress.com/2015/06/25/basic-borg-moea-use-for-the-truly-newbies-part-12/) by the Reed Lab at Cornell University.
